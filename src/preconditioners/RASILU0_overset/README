Description of the Restricted Additive Schwarz(RAS) preconditioner.


Before detailing the RAS-type preconditioner, first consider a simpler concept; the Parallel Block-Jacobi
preconditioner. In the Parallel Block-Jacobi preconditioner, each process solves its local portion of the
global matrix(using Block-Jacobi, Block-ILU0, etc.) and applies the result as a preconditioner to the local
portion of the global vector. This requires no communication, however as the number of parallel processes
increases, the local preconditioner on each process has a smaller and smaller portion of the original problem
to solve. So, the preconditioner becomes less and less effective because it has less and less information to work with.
In domain decomposition terminology, this is called Block-Jacobi since each domain is being solved independent of the 
other domains(even though the local solve could be something else like Block ILU0, etc.).




The Restricted Additive Schwarz(RAS) preconditioner includes the standard local problem information in addition to 
an overlap of elements from neighboring domains. In the present implementation, we only include one element of overlap.
Now, the preconditioning matrix includes the local problem in addition to overlap data from neighboring domains and this
is solved here using Block-ILU0. The result is only applied to the local portion of the global vector and so requires no
communication on updating the vector.

The standard Additive Schwarz(AS) preconditioner uses the same preconditioning matrix, but distributes the local solve back
to the neighboring processes as well, which requires extra communication in distributing the result. RAS is preferred 
because of the lower communication and it also has better convergence than that standard AS preconditioner.


Most of the extra files here are just containers for storing finer and finer types of data on what is being received from
overlapping domains and what is being sent to other domains.

!!  The RAS preconditioner considers the local problem and also includes a 1-element overlap with the
!!  neighboring processors and their coupling. The implementation here rearranges the problem so that
!!  all overlap data is put at the end of the preconditioning matrix. The restricted part of the
!!  preconditioner means that the solution of the preconditioning matrix is only applied to the 
!!  processor-local portion of the global vector. This is why only a portion of the x-vector is shown
!!  here in the diagram.
